## Local Build & Serve for Previewing

A script is provided to build the site locally, and serve on localhost for previewing changes on the fly.

```
./build_local.sh
```

After the build finishes, an embedded HTTP server will be launched to serve the Jekyll generated
HTML files! You can go to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a> in your browser
to preview the site. While the script isn't terminated with the embedded HTTP server still running,
any changes to the site content will be captured and the HTML files will be regenerated. After the
auto regeneration, you'll be able to see the updated content in your browser.
